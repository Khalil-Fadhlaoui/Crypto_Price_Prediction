This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow to predict the hourly price of Ethereum (ETH/USDT) by leveraging public sentiment from the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. It showcases the power of feature engineering with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the dramatic performance improvement gained by moving from classical time-series models to non-linear machine learning models like XGBoost.

**The final XGBoost model successfully reduced the prediction error (RMSE) by 86.68% compared to the initial baseline.**

## ðŸš€ The Problem

Financial markets are notoriously difficult to predict. While traditional models rely on historical price data, public sentiment, especially from influential online communities, has emerged as a potentially powerful, yet noisy, predictive signal.

This project seeks to answer the question: **Can we systematically extract sentiment from Reddit discussions to create a model that accurately forecasts cryptocurrency price movements?**

## ðŸ”§ The Approach

This project followed an iterative and hypothesis-driven approach, beginning with a simple baseline and progressively building a more sophisticated solution.

### 1. Baseline Model: SARIMAX with Basic Features
*   **Hypothesis:** The upvote `score` of Reddit posts can serve as a simple proxy for market sentiment.
*   **Action:** A SARIMAX (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) model was trained on historical ETH prices, using rolling averages of post scores as external features.
*   **Result:** The model failed to find a statistically significant relationship between post scores and price changes, resulting in a high **RMSE of $293.00**. This established our baseline performance.

### 2. Feature Engineering: NLP for Sentiment Analysis
*   **Hypothesis:** The actual *textual content* of the posts contains a much richer sentiment signal than simple upvote scores.
*   **Action:** Used the **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** library to perform sentiment analysis on the title and body of over 40,000 Reddit posts, creating a new `sentiment` feature.
*   **Result:** A new SARIMAX model trained with rolling averages of this sentiment feature showed statistically significant coefficients (especially for 8-hour and 24-hour windows) and achieved a modest performance improvement, reducing the **RMSE to $282.06**. This proved the value of NLP-driven feature engineering.

### 3. Advanced Modeling: Capturing Non-Linearity with XGBoost
*   **Hypothesis:** The relationship between market sentiment and price is complex and non-linear, a pattern that a linear model like SARIMAX cannot capture.
*   **Action:** Developed a powerful **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** regression model. Engineered a new feature set including lagged values of price and sentiment to give the model a memory of past conditions.
*   **Result:** The XGBoost model dramatically outperformed the SARIMAX model, achieving an **RMSE of just $37.56**. This represented an **86.68% reduction in error** from our best statistical model, confirming that the underlying patterns are indeed non-linear.
